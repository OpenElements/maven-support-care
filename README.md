The **Support & Care for Maven** Initiative is a groundbreaking program to help secure the future of the [Apache Maven&trade; project](https://maven.apache.org/) through sustainable support and care.
The initiative aims to strengthen the development and maintenance of Maven&trade; through funding of needed contributions to the project, thus ensuring the high quality and availability of Apache Maven&trade; that the Java ecosystem needs.

## Our Mission

Apache Maven&trade; is a critical tool in the Java ecosystem, used by millions of developers worldwide with >100 million downloads per year.
Despite its importance, Maven&trade; is maintained primarily on a volunteer basis with no fixed financial support.
Our mission is to create a sustainable source of funding for highly needed work around the Apache Maven&trade; project and direct contribution to the project. Our goal is to enable continuous improvements and professional support for Maven&trade;.

## How we work

- **Funding by a fund:** The fund provides the necessary resources to finance critical development work on Apache Maven&trade;.
- **Transparent use of funds:** Open Elements manages funding transparently and reports regularly on the progress of milestones.
- **Development by experts:** Our work is carried out by leading Maven&trade; experts.

For more details, see [our public page](https://open-elements.com/support-care-maven/#our-mission).

## Next steps

We will have an open milestone planning at the [JSail](https://jsail.ijug.eu) unconference. That meeting will be done as a face-2-face meeting.
Until that date we collect ideas for milestones that will be implemented by using ressources of **Support & Care for Apache Maven&trade;** in the [discussions section](https://github.com/OpenElements/maven-support-care/discussions) of this repository. Everyone is welcome to add ideas for milestones or comment on milestone ideas.

**Important:** It is not our plan to ignore the [Maven&trade; issue trackers](https://maven.apache.org/issue-management.html) nor [Maven&trade; contribution guidelines](https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html).
All issues that are based on the milestones that we will define in the face-2-face meeting will be handled in the Maven&trade; issue trackers and associated work will be reviewed by the wider community before merging.
This repository is used to show the work that is done by using the given funds as transparent as possible.
