The **Support & Care for Maven** Initiative is a groundbreaking program to secure the future of the Maven project through sustainable support and care.
The initiative aims to strengthen the development and maintenance of Maven through funding, thus ensuring its high quality and availability that the Java ecosystem needs.

## Our Mission

Maven is a critical tool in the Java ecosystem, used by millions of developers worldwide with >100 million downloads per year.
Despite its importance, Maven is maintained primarily on a volunteer basis with no fixed financial support.
Our mission is to create a sustainable source of funding to enable continuous improvements and professional support for Maven.

## How we work

- **Funding by a fund:** The fund provides the necessary resources to finance critical development work on Maven.
- **Transparent use of funds:** Open Elements manages funding transparently and reports regularly on the progress of milestones.
- **Development by experts:** Our work is carried out by leading Maven experts.

## Next steps

We will have an open milestone planning at the [JSail](https://jsail.ijug.eu) unconference. That meeting will be done as a face-2-face meeting.
Until that date we collect ideas for milestones that will be implemented by using ressources of **Support & Care for Maven** in the [discussions section](https://github.com/OpenElements/maven-support-care/discussions) of this repository. Everyone is welcome to add ideas for milestones or comment on milestone ideas.

**Important:** It is not our plan to ignore the [Maven issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MNG/issues).
All issues that are based on the milestones that we will define in the face-2-face meeting will be handled in the Maven issue tracker.
This repository is used to show the work that is done by using the given funds as transparent as possible.

## About us

Support & care for Maven is supported by both companies and individual community members.
Even though the initiative is managed and led by [Open Elements](https://open-elements.com), everyone involved works 100% on an equal footing.
In addition to Open Elements, the French-based company [Yupiik](https://www.yupiik.com), which specializes in the development of open source software, is also involved.
